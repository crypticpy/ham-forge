# Training Content Coverage Audit (HAM Licensing)

Date: 2026-02-14

## Scope & Sources

- Practice exams are generated by selecting **one random question from each “group”** (35 total) via `src/lib/exam-generator.ts`.
- Question pools used by the app:
  - Technician: `src/data/pools/technician.json` (effective 2022-07-01 to 2026-06-30)
  - General: `src/data/pools/general.json` (effective 2023-07-01 to 2027-06-30)
- Learning content is organized as:
  - One module per subelement (e.g., `T1`, `G3`)
  - One section per group (e.g., `T1A`, `G3C`)
  - Knowledge checks/practice use `relatedQuestionIds` on each section.

## Audit Findings (High Level)

- **All 35 exam groups exist as learning sections** for both Technician and General.
- The main gaps were in the **Commission Rules modules** (`T1` and `G1`): several groups did not cover the full breadth of their question pools and did not associate all group question IDs for practice.

The checklists below enumerate the **required coverage** for the Commission Rules modules, based directly on the pool topics for each group.

## Technician (T1) — Commission’s Rules

### T1A — Basis, definitions, coordinators, and interference

- Amateur Radio Service basis and purposes (Part 97.1 high-level purposes).
- FCC as the US regulator/enforcer for Amateur Radio.
- Phonetic alphabet use for identification (allowed; not a special emergency-only requirement).
- One operator/primary station license grant per person.
- What constitutes proof of a granted license (FCC database / ULS record).
- FCC definitions:
  - Beacon
  - Space station
- Frequency coordination:
  - What a frequency coordinator does (recommends repeater/auxiliary parameters).
  - How coordinators are selected (by local amateurs/frequency users).
- RACES definition and purpose.
- Willful interference: never permitted (no “exceptions” for annoyance or competition).

### T1B — Technician privileges, bands, and power limits

- Technician phone privileges (10m phone segment details).
- Who may contact the ISS on VHF/UHF (license class requirement).
- Identify common bands/frequencies:
  - 6m band example frequency
  - 2m band and 146.52 MHz (national simplex calling)
  - 1.25m 219–220 MHz segment purpose/restriction
- Technician phone privileges on HF (which HF band(s) allow Tech phone).
- CW-only segments that appear on the exam (e.g., weak-signal slices).
- Secondary allocations: obligations on secondary bands (do not cause harmful interference; accept interference).
- Why “don’t transmit exactly on a band edge” (practical bandwidth/drift/splatter risk).
- Where SSB phone may be used above 50 MHz (authorized phone segments exist on all such bands).
- Power limits:
  - Technician HF-segment PEP limit (10m Tech segments)
  - General “above 30 MHz” PEP limit (subject to band-specific exceptions)

### T1C — License classes, call signs, and legal authority to transmit

- Current FCC license classes available (Technician/General/Extra).
- Vanity call signs: who may request/select (eligibility at a high level).
- International communications: what is permitted in general terms (personal remarks, incidental to Amateur service purposes).
- FCC contactability requirement (maintaining a valid email; consequences of being unreachable).
- Call sign format validity for Technician issuance (common format examples).
- Where an FCC-licensed amateur station may transmit (including US-registered vessels in international waters).
- License term length and renewal/grace period.
- When you may transmit after passing an exam (when grant appears in FCC database).
- No operating during the post-expiration grace period.

### T1D — Prohibited communications and special exceptions

- International communications prohibition mechanism (ITU “objection” concept).
- One-way transmissions: what’s prohibited (broadcasting) vs allowed one-way categories (beacons/telemetry/etc.).
- Encoding/encryption: generally prohibited, with narrow telecommand exceptions.
- Music: generally prohibited, with narrow spacecraft retransmission exception.
- Equipment sales notices: permitted only in limited/non-regular ways (no “business operation”).
- Indecent/obscene language: prohibited.
- Which station types may automatically retransmit (repeater/auxiliary/space).
- Compensation: when (if ever) a control operator may be compensated (narrow classroom-instruction exception).
- Broadcasting/news gathering support: only when directly related to immediate safety of life/property.
- Definition of “broadcasting” in the Amateur service context.
- When station identification may be omitted (model craft control case).

### T1E — Control operator, control point, remote/automatic control

- Control operator required for transmissions (normal circumstances).
- Satellite/space station control operator eligibility (must be authorized on uplink).
- Who designates the control operator (station licensee).
- What determines frequency privileges in use (control operator class).
- Definition of control point.
- Technician as control operator in Extra-only segments: not permitted.
- Responsibility when control operator ≠ station licensee (shared responsibility concept).
- Automatic control examples (repeaters/beacons).
- Remote control requirements (operator at control point, indirect control, operator required).
- Remote control examples (internet-controlled station).
- FCC presumption of control operator absent station records (licensee presumed).

### T1F — Station identification, station records, repeaters, and club stations

- Station/records availability for FCC inspection (upon request).
- Tactical call sign use: how often you must still ID with FCC-assigned call sign.
- Standard identification timing (every 10 minutes; end of last transmission).
- Identification language in phone sub-bands (English).
- Identification method when transmitting phone (voice or CW acceptable as required).
- Acceptable spoken indicators for “/” in phone IDs (slash/slant/stroke).
- Third-party communications definition and restrictions for foreign contacts (third-party agreement requirement).
- Repeater definition (simultaneous retransmission on different channel(s)).
- Accountability when a repeater retransmits prohibited content (originating station control operator).
- Club station license grant requirement(s) emphasized in the pool (minimum club membership requirement).

## General (G1) — Commission’s Rules

### G1A — General class frequency privileges and allocations

- Which HF/MF bands include Extra-only segments where Generals cannot transmit.
- Bands and modes with restrictions:
  - Phone prohibited on 30 meters
  - Image transmission prohibited on 30 meters
  - Channelized operation on 60 meters (not a continuous range)
- Example band-edge knowledge that appears on the exam (e.g., 40m Extra-only portion).
- Secondary allocations: obligations on secondary bands (do not cause harmful interference; accept interference).
- 10-meter CW privileges for General (entire band).
- Extra-only HF segments (which bands have them).
- Recognizing frequencies that fall inside General-only segments (e.g., 15m).
- 10-meter repeater segment location (high end of band).
- “When you don’t get the whole phone segment”: Generals typically have the **upper** portion of voice allocations.

### G1B — Antenna structures, beacons, and permitted transmissions

- Antenna structure notification threshold (e.g., 200 feet AGL rule of thumb in the pool context).
- State/local regulation limits (PRB-1-style “reasonable accommodation” concept; preemption limits).
- Beacon stations:
  - One-per-band-per-location limitation
  - Purpose (propagation/reception observation)
  - Automatically controlled beacon frequency range (pool-specific HF range)
  - Power limit (pool-specific PEP limit)
- Transmissions permitted for all amateur stations (pool-specific example: occasional US government weather/propagation info retransmission).
- One-way transmission categories (pool-specific: Morse code practice teaching).
- Abbreviations/procedural signals: allowed if they don’t obscure meaning.
- Foreign communications: permitted except where administrations have notified the ITU of objections.
- “Good engineering and good amateur practice”: who determines it in areas not explicitly covered by Part 97.

### G1C — Power limits, bandwidth, and digital protocols

- Power limits by band:
  - 30m (10.140 MHz) limit
  - 12m and 160m (1.8 MHz) limits
  - 10m (28 MHz) limit for a General control operator
- 60m-specific rules:
  - Maximum permitted bandwidth for USB
  - Maximum power limit
  - Required recordkeeping when using antennas other than a dipole (antenna gain)
- Digital protocol introduction: requirement to publicly document technical characteristics.
- FCC maximum power measurement reference (PEP output vs input/ERP variants).

### G1D — VE program, CSCEs, upgrades, and remote operation jurisdiction

- “Element credit” / partial credit for holders of certain expired US licenses (and the non-revocation condition).
- Which exams a General-class VE may administer.
- Technician with a valid CSCE for General:
  - Which segments they may operate on immediately
  - When “/AG” identification is required (until the FCC database updates)
- Technician exam administration requirements (minimum number/class of VEs).
- VE accreditation (VEC role), minimum age, and non-US citizen eligibility (holding an FCC-granted license).
- CSCE validity period for element credit.
- Regaining General after the grace period: proof + Element 2 requirement per the pool.
- Remote control jurisdiction:
  - Controlling a US station from outside the country (license requirement)
  - Controlling a foreign station from the US (which rules apply)

### G1E — Third-party traffic, automatic control, interference avoidance, and special frequencies

- Third-party traffic disqualifiers (revoked license case).
- Cross-band retransmission condition for a 10m repeater retransmitting a 2m Technician signal (control operator class requirement).
- Automatic-control edge cases:
  - Contacting a station under automatic control outside allowed segments (initiating station must be locally/remotely controlled)
  - Where automatically controlled RTTY/data stations may communicate with each other (VHF/UHF broadly; limited HF segments)
- Interference-avoidance “special situations” from the pool:
  - Near FCC monitoring facilities
  - On secondary allocations
  - Spread spectrum usage
- Third-party message restrictions to third-party agreement countries (allowed content categories).
- ITU region applicable to amateurs in the Americas (Region 2).
- 2.4 GHz: whether amateur stations may communicate with unlicensed Wi-Fi stations.
- Spread spectrum maximum PEP limit.
- Digital modes are not exempt from third-party rules (no “mode loophole”).
- Why to avoid certain “beacon” frequencies (International beacon networks / propagation monitoring).
- When third-party messages may be transmitted via remote control (same circumstances as any third-party allowance).
